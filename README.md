# ai-telegram-forum

Run **Claude Code, Codex, OpenRouter, or OpenCode Go agents from Telegram**. Send a task to
General, and the bot creates a topic for it. Each topic keeps its own session,
conversation history, and working directory.

The bot runs on your computer or server. Agents can work on local projects,
run commands, and send files back to the chat. You can also continue an existing
Claude Code or Codex terminal session in Telegram. Access is limited to one
Telegram user.

A demo session in Materialgram: adding and testing a health endpoint.

## Installation

### 1. Prepare the machine

You need Node.js 22 or later and credentials for at least one provider:

- **Claude Code:** install and sign in to the `claude` CLI.
- **Codex:** sign in with `codex login` (after installation, `npx codex login`
  uses the project's bundled CLI).
- **OpenRouter:** get an API key; no CLI login is needed.
- **OpenCode Go:** subscribe and copy the key from
  [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth); no CLI login is needed.

On Windows, install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) so the
agent's Bash tool can use Git Bash. If Git Bash is in a nonstandard location,
set `BASH_PATH` in `.env` to its `bash.exe` path.

Run the bot as the same OS user that owns your CLI credentials and projects.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Filo6699/ai-telegram-forum.git
cd ai-telegram-forum
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Set up Telegram

1. Create a bot through [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) with `/newbot`.
   Save its token.
2. In BotFather, use `/setprivacy` to disable privacy mode for the bot.
3. Create a group, enable **Topics**, and add the bot as an administrator with
   **Manage Topics** permission.
4. Send a message in **General**. Before starting the bot, open this URL with
   your token substituted:

   ```text
   https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates
   ```

   In the response, find your message and copy `message.chat.id` (the group ID,
   usually starting with `-100`) and `message.from.id` (your user ID).

General will be the launcher for new sessions. To use a separate launcher topic,
create one, send a message there, and use its `message.message_thread_id` as
`LAUNCHER_THREAD_ID`.

### 3. Configure and start

Edit `.env` with your token, IDs, and an existing project directory:

```dotenv
BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
FORUM_CHAT_ID=-1001234567890
ALLOWED_USER_ID=123456789
LAUNCHER_THREAD_ID=General
DEFAULT_CWD=/absolute/path/to/your/project
PROJECTS={}
PROVIDER=claude
```

Set `PROVIDER` to `claude`, `codex`, `openrouter`, or `opencode-go`. For OpenRouter, also set
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and optionally `OPENROUTER_MODEL`.
Other settings are documented in [`.env.example`](./.env.example).

```bash
npm start
```

Send a task in General, choose the model settings, and confirm. The bot creates
a topic where you can continue the conversation. If you leave the picker alone,
it starts with the defaults after a short wait.

Keep the bot running to receive messages. For an always-on setup, run `npm start`
under your process manager with this repository as its working directory.

## Using it

Send tasks in the launcher:

```text
fix the failing login test
@myrepo add a health endpoint
/srv/app explain how authentication works
```

The first uses `DEFAULT_CWD`. The second uses an alias from `PROJECTS` in `.env`:

```dotenv
PROJECTS={"myrepo":"/home/you/projects/myrepo"}
```

The third uses an absolute path. The new topic remembers the directory, so you
only need the prefix when starting a session.

Within a topic, send messages, photos, or files. Images go to the agent as
images; other attachments are saved locally and passed as file paths. The agent
can send screenshots, documents, and other files back. A live status message
shows tool activity while it works.

### Commands

- `/provider` — choose Claude, Codex, OpenRouter, or OpenCode Go for the next session.
  Existing topics keep their provider.
- `/model` — choose a model or configured preset; `/model <id>` sets one directly.
- `/effort` — choose reasoning effort; `/effort high` sets it directly.
- `/stop` — interrupt the current turn while keeping the session history.
- `/btw <question>` — ask Claude or Codex a side question without interrupting
  the main task or adding the exchange to its history.
- `/usage` — show usage and available plan limits. In the launcher, show totals
  across topics. Codex allowance estimates in turn summaries are approximate.
- `/resume` — get a Claude or Codex terminal command, or a chat provider's local history path.
- `/export` — download an OpenRouter or OpenCode Go topic's transcript as Markdown.
- `/id` — show the session ID.
- `/progress off|brief|detailed` — set progress messages. In the launcher,
  this is the persistent default for new sessions; inside a topic, it changes
  only that topic.
- `/toolcalls off|only_file_edits|full` — control separate tool-call messages.

Model and effort changes apply from the next turn and persist in that topic.
In the launcher, they apply only to the next session. Use `/model default` or
`/effort default` to reset them. Progress defaults to `off`; its launcher
setting is stored across restarts. Tool-call messages also default to `off`,
and the live status message still appears.

### Continue a terminal session in Telegram

With the bot running, install the integration once from this repository:

```bash
npm run install-command
```

Then invoke it inside the terminal session you want to move:

```text
Claude Code: /telegramify
Codex:       $telegramify
```

It returns a topic link. Continue there with the same session and history.
Don't use the same session in the terminal and Telegram at the same time: both
write to the same transcript. Calling the integration again returns the existing
topic.

You can also select a session from the shell:

```bash
npm run telegramify -- --provider claude --session <session-id>
npm run telegramify -- --provider codex --session <session-id>
```

### Model presets

Defaults and optional picker presets live in `.env`:
`CLAUDE_MODEL`, `CODEX_MODEL`, `CODEX_PRESETS`, `CODEX_DEFAULT_PRESET`,
`OPENROUTER_MODEL`, and `OPENROUTER_PRESETS`.
When starting a Codex or OpenRouter session, the configured Codex presets and
OpenRouter presets appear in one picker. Choosing `Free` or `Deepseek` switches
that new topic to OpenRouter automatically. OpenCode Go presets join the same
picker under `OPENCODE_GO_PRESETS`, and its model buttons come from the live
catalog of your subscription. See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for
examples. OpenRouter and OpenCode Go appear only while their API key is
configured.

## Permissions and stored data

**Agents can edit files and run shell commands on the host machine.** Keep
`.env` private and run the bot under an OS account with access only to the
projects it needs.

`PERMISSION=auto` is the default:

- Claude and OpenRouter auto-approve tools listed in `ALLOWED_TOOLS` and ask for
  other tools in Telegram. Recognized destructive shell commands also require
  approval. Unanswered prompts expire after 10 minutes by default.
- Codex uses a `workspace-write` sandbox with network access. It cannot ask for
  interactive approval through Telegram; blocked operations return errors.

`PERMISSION=bypass` removes these approval checks and gives Codex full filesystem
access. Even in `auto`, the default tool list allows file edits and shell commands.

Idle topics are deleted after **7 days** (`DELETE_AFTER_HOURS`). This removes
the Telegram topic and its database entry, but keeps agent transcripts and
attachments on disk. Claude and Codex sessions remain resumable from the terminal.

Bot state and attachments are stored under `data/` by default. Claude and Codex
keep their native session history; OpenRouter history defaults to
`data/openrouter-sessions/` and OpenCode Go's to
`data/opencode-go-sessions/`.
